			</p>Scam is a set of Scheme modules for making publication quality printable 3D graphics. The name might be
			a bit daunting, but it falls in a rich tradition among <a href="http://www.schemers.org">Schemers</a> and 
			<a href="http://www.racket-lang.org">Racketeers</a>. It stands for Scheme CAMera. It is geared towards
			the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile">GNU Guile</a> implementation of Scheme, together with
			the <a href="http://www.cairographics.org">Cairo graphics library</a>. But, in light of portability, I try 
			to stick to using <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">R6RS</a> as much as possible.</p>
			<p>Cairo is an excellent library for creating programmable 2D vector graphics. It is very structured
			and easy to use, and can write output to many formats including SVG, PDF and PNG. Scam bundles a stack
			of functions that describe a scene, being a collection of polygons. Each polygon is a collection of
			sorted vertices and a material. To display the scene Scam projects it to a surface and plots the polygons
			in (more or less) the right order. It doesn't support proper hiding of unseen polygons <b>yet</b>. Nevertheless,
			this is enough to create some rather advanced graphics. I used Scam extensively to create the figures
			in my paper: <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.437.3442H">"J. Hidding, S. F. Shandarin and R. van de Weygaert -
			the Zeldovich Approximation: key to understanding cosmic web complexity"</a>. As an example: </p>

			<div class="illustration"></div>
			<p>There are numerous methods to create fancy 3D graphics on a computer. Sadly, most of them
			focus on bringing you interactive visualisations through OpenGL. For the printed media
			(some of us are very oldfashioned) options are limited. Say you want to plot an image of
			a torus, this can be done using <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">GNU-Plot</a>.</p>
			<img src="example_gnuplot.png" alt="Example of 3D plotting with GnuPlot.">
			<p>That looks wonderful! However, GNU-Plot has some severe limitations (for those using Python + MatplotLib,
			it has similar limitations). GNU-Plot doesn't know how to cut a polygon in half, leading to jaggedy edges
			if the mesh is not uniform. Also we cannot easily shade the surface. A package that can do highly complicated
			graphics is Mathematica. Try to export a 3D Mathematica plot to <tt>.pdf</tt> and enter hell. The resulting
			file is huge, and many printers will hang on trying to print the images. Most important of all, Mathematica is not
			free software, which would make it impossible for me to reproduce my work once I'm no longer at a University with
			plenty budgets.</p>

			<p>Scam is not for the weak hearted. At the moment it requires you to know Scheme. (this is a feature, learning
			Scheme is loads of fun, see <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">these video lectures by Abelson and Sussman</a>!) Most of all, it lacks
			a GUI, requiring the user to put in camera positions and material properties by hand. Some nifty features Scam supports now:</p>
			<ul>
			<li> Parametric surfaces, both periodic and open-ended
			<li> Generating both quadrilateral and triangulated meshes from arrays of points
			<li> Parallel projection and weak perspective cameras
			<li> Clipping polygons by a plane
			<li> Computing the boundary of meshes
			<li> Colour gradients in both RGB and HSV spaces
			</ul>
			And some on my whishlist:
			<ul>
			<li> Reading and writing <tt>.PLY</tt> files, this is the simplest format for storing 3D mesh data that is widely supported
			<li> Computing contours of a manifold for a given camera position (caustic detection)
			<li> Hiding unseen faces, requires set operations on 2D polygons (I know Inkscape can do it, but it seems like a tough problem)
			<li> Connect line segments that can be plotted at the same time (needs previous two features)
			<li> Dynamic GUI, saving and loading to Scheme coded project files (Show me a Scheme implementation with convincing high-level GTK support)
			</ul>

			<p>The source code to Scam is available on <a href="http://www.github.com/jhidding/scam">GitHub</a>.
			To download Scam say <pre>git clone https://github.com/jhidding/scam.git</pre> to your terminal
			while sitting at a decent path. The code runs on Guile 2.0 with guile-cairo.
