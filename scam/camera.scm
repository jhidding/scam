(library (scam camera)

  #|====================================================================
   | library camera
   |
   | Defines the camera. It looks at some [target] from a [position]
   | with further parameters being [shub], [zoom] and [projection].
   | While the first two arguments seem straight forward, the last
   | three would need some explaining.
   |
   | The resulting camera is a function that takes a-point and returns
   | a coordinate on the image. It transforms the point to cartesian 
   | camera coordinates, z-axis being the line of sight. These
   | coordinates are passed to the projection function, the most simple
   | of which would be the parallel projection, just returning the
   | given x and y as image coordinates.
   |
   | Parallel
   | --------
   | Given the camera position and target and a parallel projection,
   | the remaining arguments give the zoom and the rotation around the
   | line of sight. The [zoom] just scales points around the [target],
   | while the [shub] gives a vector that should point up on the image.
   |
   | Weak perspective
   | ----------------
   | There is an easy inbetween parallel and perspective projection,
   | called weak perspective. It applies a simple scaling dependent on
   | the distance on the z-axis. The zoom should be equal to the
   | parallel projection at the position of the target. Something twice
   | as far away, should appear twice as small.
   |
   | Perspective
   | -----------
   | The other obvious projection is the perspective projection.
   | However this is somewhat harder to do. It requires the definition
   | of a viewport, giving the boundaries of the image. If the
   | viewport is small, we can use azimuth and altitude to give the
   | image coordinates, however this is not identical to viewing
   | through a rectangular frame, is it? The edges of the rectangle, it
   | being perpendicular to the line of sight, follow great circles of
   | the sphere on which we can put the corners. These great circles
   | intersect in the axis parallel to the corresponding edges. These
   | are the [shub] and [shub] x [l.o.s.].
